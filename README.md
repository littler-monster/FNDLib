# FNDLib
FNDLib is an open-source fake news detection platform, and here our team reproduces some classic fake news detection algorithms, which can be directly used by researchers  

The dataset used by this platform needs to be processed as an npy file, you can process the csv and tsv files through the process.py file, and then select the model you want to run in config.  

The team welcomes you to add new models, and if you wish, you can create the schema code of the model in the model folder. If necessary, you can also modify it without changing the original logic of the FNDLib.py file.
